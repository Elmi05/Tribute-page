        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Born in 1952, Maxamed Dahir Afrax's literary journey began at a young age. He showed a deep passion for
             writing and storytelling, even during his early years. Afrah started his literary work in Mogadishu
              in the late 1970s by publishing weekly papers and short novels in the national journal Xiddigta
               Oktober (October Star). In 1972, he started publishing his own journal in Somali, where he wrote 
               about the social changes and their impact on Somali society. According to Afrah, despite social
                change being a way of human interaction,
             he was worried that the new cultural and social transformation would have a negative impact on society.
